#Obstacles to the Gospel

Using statistics for the number of people who die each year and the estimated percentage of Christians, I performed calculations to help us visualize what is happening around us each day. 

##<a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
This program is a real-time mortality counter. It shows the number of lost individuals estimated to have died in the time elapsed since the application was started (it also shows the total number of people estimated to have died in a given time-frame). More conservative theologians say less than **8%** of the world population is saved while more liberal theologians say **32%** is saved. Either way, the number is terrible. In this program and sermon, I have split the difference and used **20%** as the reached-rate. I am going to leave the counter running so we can see how many people have entered eternity without Christ during this message.

**Let’s Pray.**

Father, speak to us today; give us your heart and your desire for the world. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

##<a name="after"></a>After 2,000 Years
We received the command from God to evangelize the world 2,000 years ago.

Why then, will at least _80_ of every _100_ persons burn in Hell for eternity if they do not accept Jesus as their only Savior? Why then do _141,322_ of _153,444_ people who die in the world every day go to Hell? Your family, your friends, your co-workers, your neighbors?

While these statistics are very powerful and sad, they need to be seen so we can examine the reality of our actions and think about the question, why are so few people saved?

Is it because there isn’t enough pastors? Or is it because we do not have enough space in our churches? Or do we need more missionaries? Or could it be because our church services are too boring? Or perhaps, we do not have enough events and programs in our church?

 The answer to each of those questions is no. However, the answer can be seen very clearly in a mirror.

##<a name="we-are-the-problem"></a>We are the problem!
Jesus made our responsibilities as disciples and Christians very clear. He commanded us to make disciples. He wants us to multiply. The Bible says God does not want any to perish. Furthermore, He equipped us for the task. However, we have failed miserably. To improve, we need to understand the obstacles confronting us and our sacred task. 

##<a name="obstacles"></a>Obstacles

###<a name="pastor"></a>The Pastor’s Responsibility
One obstacle is our thoughts about the pastor’s responsibility.

We believe one of the reasons we pay this man is to evangelize. Plus, he has likely graduated from seminary. So it is logical to think he has the skills necessary to complete the task. This all may be true, but what does the Bible say?

First, the Great Commission was given to all followers of Christ, not only to pastors. Therefore, going and making disciples is the responsibility of each of us. 
Second, the Bible says in _Ephesians 4:11-12 (HCSB), “And He personally gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, for the training of the saints in the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ,”_ Therefore, in addition to evangelizing, the pastor should also train and motivate the members of the church to do the same. Take note, God wants to use all of the body of Christ instead of just pastors. 

###<a name="hell"></a>The Reality of Hell
Another obstacle is many people in the church do not understand, or do not believe, in the reality of Hell, even though the Bible mentions it at least 40 times and describes it as a place of eternal suffering. They are not convinced Jesus Christ is the only way to God. They think or hope our God is so loving that He will find another way for everyone to go to heaven. However, our God has already provided the only way: Jesus.

###<a name="urgency"></a>Lack of Urgency
Another obstacle is we do not treat the return of Christ with urgency. 2,000 years has already passed, so what’s the rush? Regardless of when Jesus returns, the Bible says the judgment comes after death—eternity starts when you die. We already know more than _100,000_ people die each day in the world. This means _107_ people are entering eternity every minute and only _22_ of those are saved. Or, using the statistics for the Americas, excluding United States, around **72,440** people will enter eternity this week, with **57,952** of those people going to Hell. You know some of these people and have an opportunity to share the gospel with them. Our message is urgent.

###<a name="church"></a>The Church
Sometimes, the church is an obstacle to missions. Let me explain. Many in the church believe serving God is realized inside the walls of the church. Yes, some parts of the Great Commission such as teaching and training occur inside the church. However, our mission includes going and making disciples who multiply. These new disciples will learn how to do missions when they see us living a missional lifestyle each day. This multiplication must be performed outside of the church as we go about our daily lives. Satan is satisfied and content if we keep to ourselves in the church praising God. 

###<a name="purpose"></a>Lack of Intentionality
Another obstacle is we do not make missions one of the intentions in our relationships. Intentional means doing something deliberately. We meet dozens of people each day. We talk about work, weather, children, sports, pets, politics, school, and new smart phone apps without even thinking about or searching for an opportunity to speak about Jesus. Opportunities to speak about Christ are all around us. The Bible says in _Ephesians 2:10 (HCSB), “For we are His creation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time so that we should walk in them.”_ We only have to be obedient.

Occasionally, we may ask someone if they attend church. If they answer no, we invite them to our church. We also tell them we have a great band and our pastor is cool. In addition, we may mention our church has lots of singles so they might find a date there or we tell them how great the programs for our children are. We may also mention how we always go out with our friends from church. All of this may be true, but this IS NOT evangelism.

Too often we only have superficial relationships. We lack intentionality. We are ambassadors of Christ all of the time. _1 Peter 3.15 (HCSB) “but honor the Messiah as Lord in your hearts. Always be ready to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you.”_ Do we have hope? Of course we do so let's be intentional about sharing it.

####<a name="testimony"></a>Your Testimony
Being prepared to share your testimony is a very important part of being intentional. If you have not written or at least thought about your testimony in advance, it will be more difficult to clearly share the gospel. It must be short (three or four minutes) and include/explain:

1. A brief description of your life before you were saved;
2. Your understanding of being guilty for your sins;
3. Your understanding of being spiritually separated from God;
4. Your recognition you could only be made acceptable to God by what Jesus did for you;
5. How you let Jesus take control of your life; 
6. How your life has changed since you became a Christian; and
7. How you have confidence in where you will spend eternity.

Remember, your testimony should be centered on Jesus and his grace, not around yourself. You should not care about impressing the other person with your story; rather, you should focus on glorifying Jesus thru your testimony. 

It is very important to ask the person if they want to accept Jesus as their Savior. If they do, you have the privilege and responsibility of disciplining this person so they grow in their love for God and are capable of multiplying (making disciples who make disciples). This is what going and making disciples is all about. 

###<a name="unity"></a>Lack of Unity
The relationships between the members of the church, the body of Christ, also gives a testimony to the world. In _John 17:21 (HCSB)_ Jesus prayed like this: _“May they all be one, as You, Father, are in Me and I am in You. May they also be one in Us,_ [Why?] _so the world may believe You sent Me.”_ To be in unity with brothers is more than lifting your hand in church to vote over something. The Bible says if you are really united in God, the world will believe Jesus is His Son, the Savior of the world. Generally though, the world cannot see any difference between how Christians deal with conflicts and the way the world deals with them. Christian couples divorce, people leave the church because they are offended, and churches split because of internal fights. It’s not a surprise that the world does not believe Jesus came to bring peace between ourselves and God when so little evidence of this being possible exists among the people of God.

But, when our daily behavior expresses the reality of the teachings of Christ, the world will believe the message of Jesus is true.

###<a name="fear"></a>Fear
Fear is another obstacle:

- Fear of letting God take control of your life;
- Fear of offending someone;
- Fear of not being able to answer all questions and doubts; or
- Fear of either you and/or your message being rejected.

While fear is normal for humans, the Bible says in _2 Timothy 1:7-8 (HCSB), “For God has not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but one of power, love, and sound judgment. So don’t be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord”_ and in _John 16:8 (HCSB) "When He_ [Holy Spirit] _comes, He will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment:"_ Thus, God wants us to be obedient and to testify--He is in charge of everything else. 

Some people say they do not know how to bring the gospel into their conversations. Various methods and conversational bridges exist to make this easier. For example, if someone is telling a story, you could respond in one of the following ways:

- This reminds me of a Biblical story. Can I tell it to you?
- Do you want to know what the Bible says about this topic?

As another example, someone may be discussing their problems and you could respond with, “God cares about all of our problems, would you like me to pray for yours now?” 

Finding people God has already prepared and changing the conversation to a spiritual theme is an easy method. If a person says, no, I do not want to listen, this only means the Holy Spirit is not working with this person at this particular time and you could respond, okay. But if the person gives you permission to speak about the gospel, you have a great opportunity to share the good news and your testimony. Moreover, this is more effective than only giving someone a gospel tract. The idea is to be intentional. If you are not prepared, the opportunities will pass by without eternal results.

###<a name="love"></a>Lack of Love
Despite all of the other obstacles, I think the greatest obstacle we each face is our lack of love. We are egotistical. We prefer to be comfortable and safe. We are also lazy. We do not make ourselves available to invest in the lives of the lost. Jesus says in _John 15:13 (HCSB), “No one has greater love than this, that someone would lay down his life for his friends.”_ and in _John 3:16a (HCSB), “'For God loved the world in this way: He gave His One and Only Son...'”_. In the heart of God, to give is always part of love.

See the souls passing by on the screen. Look, how many have already entered eternity without Christ in only **XX** amount of time. Imagine they are here today, in a line, passing by one by one. How can you see this and not do anything? How many more have to die without Christ before we have sufficient compassion to do something? Compassion without action is worthless, it’s not love. 

Someone might say this isn’t important to them. If someone thinks like this, they either are very far from God or do not really know Him (i.e., aren't a Christian). Someone might also say, I will do something about this when Jesus tells or commands me to do so. Do not wait for a telephone call, He has already given the command to you--listen!

Some may say, I’m ready, I want to do more for missions. Others may say, I feel called to be an evangelist, a pastor, or a missionary. Others could respond, I am convicted to be more intentional in my relationships. 

Listen and obey what the Holy Spirit is saying to you. The eternal destiny of thousands and thousands of souls depend on you. You have the resources, the conditions, and opportunities to rescue some. What will you do?

##<a name="the-call"></a>Will you answer the call?

###<a name="pray"></a>Let’s Pray
Dear Father, we know your desire is for everyone to be saved. Because You love everyone so much you sent your only son for us. Please do what is necessary to make us have the same desire, the same love, the same heart as You. In the name of Jesus, amen.

I have provided a sheet of paper which provides tips about what to include in your testimony and also some key verses you can share with those with whom you are witnessing. The goal is to encourage and better equip you to share the gospel. 

###<a name="calling-the-lost"></a>Calling the Lost
It’s possible someone here does not already have a personal relationship with Jesus. If you are not sure where you will spend eternity when you die, I would like to speak with you more so you can have peace in your heart about this very important matter.
