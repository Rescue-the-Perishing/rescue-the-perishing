 * Each of the values to be changed are within double quotes (`"`) following a colon (`: `).
 * Double quotes (`"`) are *not* permitted within the provided values.
 * Nothing else within this file should be changed.
 * If this syntax is not adhered to, the program will not work as expected.
 * Each of the phrases accept alpha-numeric values.

<<<<<<< HEAD
 * In some languages, a preposition should not be added to the end of the `rtpPeople` and `rtpLost`
 * phrases because the preposition needed may change based on the user's provided location.
 * For example, in Italian the correct preposition would need to be "nel" (literally "in the") if the provided
 * location was the Italian equivalent of world or "in" (literally "in") if the provided location was the
 * Italian equivalent of Italy. Leaving off the preposition in the translation file helps overcome this issue
 * because the location can be prefixed with the correct preposition in the defaults file and/or by the user
 * at runtime.
